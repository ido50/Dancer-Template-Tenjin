NAME
    Dancer::Template::Tenjin - Tenjin wrapper for Dancer

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
            # in your config.yml
            template: "tenjin"

            # note: templates must used the '.tt' extension

DESCRIPTION
    This class is an interface between Dancer's template engine abstraction
    layer and the Tenjin module.

    Tenjin is a fast and feature-full templating engine that can be used by
    Dancer for production purposes. In comparison to Template::Toolkit, it
    is much more lightweight, has almost no dependencies, and supports
    embedded Perl code instead of defining its own language.

    In order to use this engine, you need to set your webapp's template
    engine in your app's configuration file (config.yml) like so:

        template: "tenjin"

    You can also directly set it in your app code with the set keyword.

    Now you can create Tenjin templates normally, but note that due to a
    Dancer restriction your templates files must end in the '.tt' extension.

TODO
    * Non-file sources

      Find a way to allow using templates from other source, such as a
      database, just like in Catalyst::View::Tenjin.

    * Fine-tune Tenjin

      Allow passing arguments to Tenjin, such as USE_STRICT.
